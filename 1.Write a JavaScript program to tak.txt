1.Write a JavaScript program to take an array as input from the user and calculate
the sum of numbers in odd places and the sum of numbers at even places.
a) Print the difference between the two sums
b) Print the number of elements in odd places
c) Print the number of elements in even places
d) Print the average of all elements in the array
e) Print GCD of Sum of Numbers at Odd Places and Sum of Numbers at Even
Places
Sample Input:
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Explanation:
Sum of Numbers at Odd Places = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Sum of Numbers at Even Places = 2 + 4 = 6
Difference = 9 - 6 = 3
Sample Output:
Difference = 3
Odd Elements = 3
Even Elements = 2
Average = 3
GCD = 3


ANS:

function calculateArrayStats(arr) {
  let sumOdd = 0;
  let sumEven = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      // Element at even index
      sumEven += arr[i];
    } else {
      // Element at odd index
      sumOdd += arr[i];
    }
  }

  const difference = sumOdd - sumEven;
  const numElementsOdd = Math.ceil(arr.length / 2);
  const numElementsEven = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const totalSum = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  const average = totalSum / arr.length;
  const gcd = calculateGCD(sumOdd, sumEven);

  console.log("a) Difference between the sums of numbers at odd and even places:", difference);
  console.log("b) Number of elements in odd places:", numElementsOdd);
  console.log("c) Number of elements in even places:", numElementsEven);
  console.log("d) Average of all elements in the array:", average);
  console.log("e) GCD of Sum of Numbers at Odd Places and Sum of Numbers at Even Places:", gcd);
}

function calculateGCD(a, b)
 {
                            // Implement Euclidean algorithm to calculate GCD
  if (b === 0) {
    return a;
  } else 
{
    return calculateGCD(b, a % b);
  }
}

// Example usage with the provided array:
            const exampleArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
            calculateArrayStats(exampleArray);




for given example:
  a) Difference between the sums of numbers at odd and even places: -5
b) Number of elements in odd places: 5
c) Number of elements in even places: 4
d) Average of all elements in the array: 5
e) GCD of Sum of Numbers at Odd Places and Sum of Numbers at Even Places: 3
